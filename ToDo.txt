DrawDebugWorld
Create an option that draws bodies as solid rather than wire frames.
Add some kind of config options.
Add draw color by material option.

TestWorld4
Currently a copy of TestWorld3. Create a material collider test bed out of it.

Create draggable bodies so the test worlds are more interactive.

Does VectorTools.isCCW even need to be fixed? Unit test is currently commented out.
