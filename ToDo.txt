ToDo:
    Does VectorTools.isCCW even need to be fixed? Unit test is currently commented out.
    Ensure callback on collision works.

Test screens:
    1. Unit Test world
    2. Static, scaled amd rotated bodies, No gravity or mouse control
    3. Basic gravity sandbox with spring and pressure bodies
    4. Material collision filtering with custom draw options
    5. Custom control and collision callbacks
